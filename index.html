      Born in 1928 in Okayama, Japan, Akira Miyawaki was a Botanist and Professor Emeritus at Yokohama National University.
      He was an expert in plant ecology, specializing in seeds and the study of natural forests,
      and was active worldwide as a specialist in restoring the natural vegetation on degraded land.
      His method, known as the "Miyawaki method", involves the reconstitution of "indigenous forests
      by indigenous trees" as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Rigorous initial site survey and research of potential natural vegetation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Identification and collection of a large number of various native seeds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Germination in a nursery.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preparation of the spoil depending on the level of degradation, if it is in areas with heavy or torrential rainfall, or on hilly slopes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dense plantation of very young seedlings in a way that respects the biodiversity inspired by the model of the natural forest.  The dense plantation aims at promoting competition between species close to what would happen in nature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Plantations randomly distributed in space in the way plants are distributed in a clearing or at the edge of the natural forest, not in rows or staggered.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      While the reconstitution of indigenous forest though natural succession is estimated to need 200 years in temperate climates and 300 to 500 years in the tropics, his method has seen the successful restoration of forests in a tenth of the time.
      During his lifetime, he instructed people in over 1,700 areas around the world, his method has seen the successful restoration of forests in a wide variety of ecosystems and climates, and he received numerous awards and prizes for his efforts.
